# NoWCF

--- STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ---

WCF-like, TCP-based, protocol/callback implementation, without the various hassels of setting up and random issues with WCF.

The vision is essentially creating a convenient WCF alternative.

Communication can be encrypted with a passphrase, and additionally with a Private/Public (RSA) keypair using common certificate in both ends.

Check the example apps for implementation code..
